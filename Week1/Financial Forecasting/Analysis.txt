Time Complexity of Recursive Algorithm
The recursive function calls itself once per year, so:

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) due to call stack usage

Each call depends on the result of the previous yearâ€™s forecast.

Suitable for short-term forecasts but inefficient for large n due to growing recursion depth.




Optimization of Recursive Solution
Convert to Iteration:

Replace recursion with a loop.

Reduces space complexity from O(n) to O(1)

More efficient and safer for large input sizes.

Use Memoization (if recurrence is complex):

Store previously computed results in an array.

Avoids redundant calculations in recursive calls.

Useful in more complex models .

Tail Recursion (in some languages):

Some compilers optimize tail-recursive functions.

Java does not optimize tail recursion by default, so prefer iteration.
