 Comparison of Time Complexity
  
Linear Search:

-Best Case: O(1) (element is at the start)
-Average Case: O(n)
-Worst Case: O(n) (element is at the end or not present)

Binary Search:

-Best Case: O(1) (element is in the middle)
-Average Case: O(log n)
-Worst Case: O(log n)

Conclusion: Binary search is significantly faster than linear search for large datasets due to logarithmic growth.



Which Algorithm is More Suitable and Why?

Binary Search is more suitable for an e-commerce platform because:

-Product lists are often large, and binary search is more scalable.
-Users expect fast, real-time search results.
-You can pre-sort or index product data by product name or ID.
-Works well with structured databases and backend optimization.

Linear Search is suitable for:

-Small datasets
-Quick prototypes or development testing
-Situations where data isn’t sorted and sorting isn’t worth the overhead
